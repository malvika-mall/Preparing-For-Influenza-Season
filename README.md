## Project Goal:
To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for staffing needs across the country.
## Project Overview:
* Motivation: The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff.
* Objective: Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.
* Scope: The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.
## Data Sets:
The following data sets covering influenza in the United States were used during the project:
1. Influenza deaths by geography, time, age, and gender
Source: CDC
[Download Data Set](https://github.com/malvika-mall/Preparing-For-Influenza-Season/blob/main/CDC_Influenza_Deaths_edited.xlsx)
2. Population data by geography
Source: US Census Bureau
[Download Data Set](https://github.com/malvika-mall/Preparing-For-Influenza-Season/blob/main/Census_Population_transformed_202101.csv)
NOTE: keep in mind that these numbers are estimates, hence the sum of the numbers from the different age groups may not sum up to the total in the first columns, but that’s totally okay.
## Exploratory Data Analysis:
* Hypothesis: “If any state has more vulnerable patients, then there are high chances of influenza outbreak”.

* As per historical data available; California, Florida, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania are top 5 Hotspots of Influenza in US that would need more medical staff deployed in comparison to other States.
